This is Bitcoin Deanonymizer application project. For that, we have used Bitnode API. Bitnode is a Big Project that is currently being developed to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network.

Implemented a node and run it in the Blockchain and generated python scripts that keep listening all broadcasted messages to find the IP address bound to each Bitcoin transaction.

Analyzed those transactions data in Python, mapped IP addresses to geo-location and visualized it to World Map to uncover hidden patterns.
